# Code Katas

This is a collection of code katas with solutions in Java.

## Kata 01: Find Longest String of 2 different chars. 

Return the longest contiguous substring of 2 distinct characters from an input string.

Example 01
```
input: abbaacab
output : abbaa
```

Example 02
```
input: abcefabbabaabefghghfa 
return: abbabaab
```

Example 03
```
input: aabceddddcdccecabceftg 
return: ddddcdcc
```

Example 04
```
input: acbabbcbca 
return : bbcbc
````

return: IX
```

Example 03
```
input: 18 
return: XVII
```

Example 04

input: 44 
return : XLIV
````

## Kata 03: Eliminate Elements from List

Write a function to return a copy of a list of strings with duplicates removed. Preserve order in the original list as 
much as possible (keep first occurrence).

Example
```
input: ["foo", "bar", "baz", "foo", "bar"]
output: ["foo", "bar", "baz"]
```

## Kata 04: Shuffle List

Suppose you have a deck of cards represented as a linked list. You can perfectly shuffle that list by cutting it at the 
halfway point, then interleaving the two halves by alternating back and forth between the cards. For example, suppose 
you want to perfectly shuffle this sequence:
```
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```

You'd start by splitting it into two halves, like this:
```
1 2 3 4 5 
```
```
6 7 8 9 10
```
Then, you'd interleave the halves, like this:
```
6 1 7 2 8 3 9 4 10 5
```
The resulting list is said to have been perfectly shuffled. Your job is to write a function that accepts as input a 
pointer to a linked list with an even number of elements, then reÂ­ arranges the elements in that list so that they're 
perfectly shuffled.

## Kata 05: Sum Sub Array list

A subarray of an array is a consecutive sequence of zero or more values taken out of that array. For example, the array 
[1, 3, 7] has seven subarrays:
[] [1] [3] [7] [1,3] [3,7] [1,3,7]
Notice that [1, 7] is not a subarray of [1, 3, 7], because even though the values 1 and 7 appear in the array, they're 
not consecutive in the array. Similarly, the array [7, 3] isn't a subarray of the original array, because these values
are in the wrong order.

The sum of an array is the sum of all the values in that array. Your task is to write a function that takes as input an 
array and outputs the sum of all of its subarrays. For example, given [1, 3, 7], you'd output 36, because


[ ] + [1] + [3] + [7] + [1, 3] + [3, 7] + [1, 3, 7] = 0 + 1 + 3 + 7 + 4 + 10 + 11 = 36

## Kata 06: Create a balanced Binary Search Tree. 

CS101.

Balanced:  The heights of the two child subtrees of any node differ by at most one. (Wikipedia: AVL-Tree) 

## Kata 07: Find smallest Range in a list of Int. 

You have k lists of sorted integers. Find the smallest range that includes at least one number from each of the k lists.

For example,
List 1: [4, 10, 15, 24, 26]
List 2: [0, 9, 12, 20]
List 3: [5, 18, 22, 30]

The smallest range here would be [20, 24] as it contains 24 from list 1, 20 from list 2, and 22 from list 3.
